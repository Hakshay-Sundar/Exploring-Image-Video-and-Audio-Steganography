# Welcome to Steganography!

**What is Steganography?**

Steganography is a process that intends to hide data in other objects such as images, audio, videos, network traffic, computer files, etc... such that it does not arouse any suspicion. 
Any person who encounters this medium would not realize that it holds some secret. Unlike Cryptography, the very existence of hidden data is a secret.
Steganography has been around for centuries. However, it is not as popular as Cryptography.

**What have I explored in this project?**

In this project, I have explored Image Steganography, Audio Steganography, and Video Steganography.
I have also explored using a HuggingFace Transformer for Image Generation which aided me in exploring Image Steganography.

I have explored LSB — Lease Significant Bit — substitution for all 3 categories. Additionally, I have played around with Phase Coding for Audio Steganography.

I was curious about the benefits of Morse Code in Digital Steganography since the origins of this process also included some ciphers. Morse Code was used earlier but
it has never been explored in digital steganography. I came up with a custom encoding and standardization of representations for alphabets that maintained the space requirement of ASCII but 
it increased the security as it added a layer of security for the hidden messages.
